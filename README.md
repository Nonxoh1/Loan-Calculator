<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple loan calculator built with Python. It's a command-line utility designed to help users calculate loan repayment schedules using the **simple interest formula**.

Users input their name, loan amount, tenure (in months), and annual interest rate. The program calculates the total interest, monthly repayments, and shows a detailed month-by-month breakdown â€” including principal, interest, and outstanding balances.

It's useful for microfinance use-cases, personal finance tracking, and beginner-level financial modeling.
